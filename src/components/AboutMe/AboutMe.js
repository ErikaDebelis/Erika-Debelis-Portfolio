      I guess we'll start with the basics! My name is obviously Erika Debelis. I was born in New Hampshire and didn't move out to Portland until 2018. I road-tripped over with my sister, Michelle; we each filled up each of our cars all the way to the brim and said 'Adios'. Over the course of 9 days we travelled across the country, on our way to our new lives and escaping the northeast coast and the 6 months of winter every year. I went to college for a few years straight out of high school but didn't have a clear path in mind so when I had completed all of my gen-ed courses I hit somewhat of a wall on how to move forward. This prompted me to put my education on pause until I could get inspired by a career path to pursue. In the interim, I had several jobs that helped me realize some important things about me and my strong suits. I learned that I tend to enjoy the technical work much more than any customer service type role I preform. I worked at a hotel that used a DOS operating system and interface and picked up on the functionality much quicker than others. Where others would tend to get frustrated by the interface; I was intrigued. Eventually I ended up working as an insurance underwriter and over time came to terms with how unfullfilled I felt in the field. It became clear to me that I needed to make a change to find more positivity in my work so I decided it was time to unpause my education and career exploration. I have always excelled in math and eventually in my research of career options and local schools/programs, stumbled upon Epicodus. I feel more hopeful and engaged through this bootcamp than I thought possible. I hope this is helpful in getting a clearer view of who I am and how I think and code.
